# Fleet Network Pattern

A reusable shape for letting multiple local-only apps reach each other (and
each other's data services) by stable hostname, without containerising the
apps themselves and without hardcoding host-port juggling into every cross-app
call.

## What this pattern produces

A single top-level `infra/` directory at the laptop's app-fleet root (e.g.
`/Users/donkeyking/development/infra/`) containing:

- `docker-compose.yml` — declares one external Docker network (`fleet-net`)
  with no services. The anchor.
- `README.md` — codifies the host-port convention, lists currently attached
  containers, explains the Docker Desktop multi-network caveat, and tells new
  apps how to join.

Each app's existing data containers (Postgres, Redis, etc.) get attached to
`fleet-net` via `docker network connect fleet-net <container>` — no
recreation, no volume risk.

The pattern is **infra-only**. It does not containerise the apps. Native
processes (Django runserver, FastAPI uvicorn, Vite dev server) keep running
on the host and reach each other via `localhost:<port>`. Cross-app addressing
becomes useful when one or more apps later containerise — they can then resolve
each other by service name without any further plumbing.

## When to use this

You have:

1. Two or more apps on the same laptop that need to talk to each other locally
2. At least one cross-app call (HTTP, DB, queue) currently hardcoded as
   `http://localhost:<port>`
3. A near-term need to either run those apps concurrently (port collision
   risk) or containerise one of them (service-name addressing risk)

If any of those is missing, this pattern is overkill — `localhost:port` works
fine.

## When not to use this

- Single-app local dev — no cross-app calls, no need for shared network.
- Fully containerised stack already — your `docker-compose.yml` per app
  probably already handles networking; this pattern only solves the
  mixed-native + container case.
- Production deployment plumbing — this is local-dev only. Production
  networking is per-platform (Railway, Fly.io, Kubernetes, etc.) and out of
  scope for this pattern.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a docker-compose for the entire fleet.** Each app keeps its own
  compose file in its own repo. The anchor declares only the shared network.
- **Not a service mesh.** No traffic policy, no TLS, no service discovery
  beyond Docker's built-in DNS.
- **Not a port reservation system.** The host-port policy in the README is
  documented convention, not enforced.
- **Not a production deployment artifact.** Local-dev plumbing only.

## What you get when this works

- New fleet apps can `docker network connect fleet-net <container>` and reach
  every other attached service by stable hostname.
- Future containerised apps can declare `fleet-net` as external in their own
  compose file and resolve `udb-postgres:5432`, `cos-redis:6379`, etc. by name
  without knowing the host's IP or port mappings.
- A discoverable single source of truth — anyone running `ls
  /Users/donkeyking/development/infra/` sees the convention exists.
- A fleet-wide overview via `docker network inspect fleet-net`.

## The Docker Desktop caveat

Attaching a running container to a second Docker network on Docker Desktop
(macOS) sometimes silently breaks its host-port mapping. The container still
listens on its internal port; cross-network DNS keeps working; but host
processes (`psql -h localhost -p <port>`, native Django) start timing out.

**Fix**: `docker restart <name>` — re-establishes the host-port bridge. No
data loss. Document this in your `infra/README.md` so future attachments don't
trip on it cold.

  context-kit subcommand would automate.

  `infra/` directory).
- `templates/README.md` — the manifest template (fill in your fleet's
  containers + host-port policy).

## Worked example

The first instance of this pattern lives at
`/Users/donkeyking/development/infra/` and connects unified-donkey-betz +
character-os + their data services (2 Postgres, 2 Redis). Session 1117 used
it to set up the engine-bridge realtime tool path between Character OS and
u-d-b's PA. See:

- `/Users/donkeyking/development/infra/README.md` — the manifest as actually
  shipped.
- `unified-donkey-betz/docs/handoffs/SESSION_1117_LOCAL_PORTFOLIO_GROUNDING_BRIDGE.md` —
  the session context for why this pattern was needed and what it unblocked.
